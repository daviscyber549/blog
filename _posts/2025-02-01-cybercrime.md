# The Evolution of the Internet (Cybercrime)
The invention of the internet has introduced many positives that have boosted our evolution. It has enabled unlimited real‑time communication and quick access to information. Its continuous growth also brings innovations that promise to amplify these benefits even further. However, like most innovations, the internet also comes with significant downsides. Cybercrime is one of the major concerns that evolves alongside the internet itself.

##Cybercrime vs. Real‑World Crime
The internet has created a virtual world that mirrors the physical one. This allows us to carry out real‑life activities—shopping, working, learning, advertising, communicating—directly from our homes. To make this possible, we’ve converted essential data such as funds and identity into digital form.

With this transition comes the rise of cybercrime. Just as the internet amplifies positive capabilities, it also amplifies criminal ones. It is now possible to be robbed at home by someone who is also at home, potentially on the other side of the world. Because the internet is global, cybercrime can range from petty scams to attacks with war‑level impact.

## Common Threats and Impact
### Common cybercrime tactics include:

Phishing attacks

Man‑in‑the‑Middle (MitM) attacks

Denial‑of‑Service (DoS) attacks

Social engineering

Password attacks

Web‑based attacks

Ransomware

AI‑generated attacks

Deepfakes

Cryptojacking

We are moving from an era where hacking required significant skill and time to an era of AI‑driven attacks (Abdullah et al., 2025). We are also entering a stage where “seeing is no longer believing.” For example, during the Russia‑Ukraine war, deepfake technology was used to spread misinformation using the likeness of the Ukrainian president. Deepfakes threaten core cybersecurity principles, especially integrity.

Cybercrime can also have global consequences. In 2017, North Korean hackers launched a massive ransomware attack that compromised over 300,000 computers across more than 150 countries (Bartlett, 2020). There have also been allegations of foreign interference in U.S. elections.

## Ethics
Smaller‑scale cyberattacks often target the elderly. With limited familiarity with modern technology, they are more vulnerable to telemarketing scams, prize and sweepstakes fraud, and phishing attempts (Bruce, 2008).

On a global scale, small businesses and time‑sensitive organizations suffer the most. The United States maintains a policy of not negotiating with terrorists, yet ransomware attacks like WannaCry affected hundreds of hospitals in both the UK and the US. While the standard advice is not to pay ransoms, the ethical dilemma becomes more complex when lives are at stake.

In the mid‑1990s, shortly after the internet’s rise, countries recognized the need for coordinated action against cybercrime. After four years of negotiation, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime—also known simply as The Convention was established (Jamil, 2012). More recently, the UN introduced another cybercrime convention in 2024.

These efforts are promising, but as the saying goes, “war is dirty.” Global policies work in civilized contexts, but what limits exist during wartime? Should there be cyber‑equivalents to war crimes? Are such limitations even feasible?

## Reflection
Cyber warfare involves two types of people: good actors and bad actors. Both groups have similar training, education, and the freedom to switch sides. The difference is that good actors set the challenge.

Throughout this research and my studies in cybersecurity, it seems that society and perhaps the world races headfirst into new technologies and worry about the consequences later. Artificial intelligence, for example, is largely left in the hands of its creators to assess risks, with little oversight on long‑term impacts. Schools are already struggling to adapt to AI’s rapid influence on education.
