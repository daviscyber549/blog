<section>
I’m Dwequieve Davis, a Cybersecurity major at Chestnut Hill College with a passion for understanding how technology works and how to protect it. Before transferring, I earned my associate degree from the Community College of Philadelphia, where I built the foundation for my technical journey.

My interests span programming, particularly in Python and JavaScript, as well as the investigative world of digital forensics. Whether I’m analyzing data, tracing digital footprints, or building something new from scratch, I’m driven by curiosity and a love for problem‑solving.

Originally from Jamaica, I carry a deep appreciation for culture, rhythm, and creativity. Music is a big part of my life, and when I’m not immersed in code or cybersecurity labs, you’ll probably find me at a piano exploring melodies.

This blog is where I share my learning, projects, insights, and the intersections between technology, security, and creativity.
